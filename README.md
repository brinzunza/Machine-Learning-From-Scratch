# Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

This is a project that I am putting on myself to fully understand the math and logic behind many popular machine learning algorithms. I believe there is no better way to truly understand something than to be able to implement it from the basics. Therefore the workflow will look like this: 
 - Read online about theory, math, and logic
 - Implement it using libraryless python
 - Create testers to validate implementation

## Algorithms
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Linear Regression

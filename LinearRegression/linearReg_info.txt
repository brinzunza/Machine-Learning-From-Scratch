Linear Regression

- given a plot of points, find the line of best fit between variables by minimizing sum of distance between points and line. 
    - can be estimated using gradient descent (faster for larger datasets) or can be exactly calculated (slower)

- formula sum(diff(xi - mean x) * diff(yi - mean y)) / sum(diff(xi - mean x) ** 2)
